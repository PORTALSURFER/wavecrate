# ANN Container Format

This document describes the single-file ANN index container stored alongside each
source `library.db` file. The container replaces the legacy `ann/` directory
pair of `*.hnsw.graph`/`*.hnsw.data` plus `*.idmap.json`.

## Location

- Current container path: `similarity_hnsw.ann` in the same folder as `library.db`.
- Legacy files (migration source): `<source>/ann/similarity_hnsw.hnsw.*` and
  `<source>/ann/similarity_hnsw.idmap.json`.

## Layout (v1)

All integers are little-endian. The file is a header followed by payload blocks.

- Header (104 bytes)
  - Magic: `SANNIDX1` (8 bytes)
  - Version: `u32` (currently `1`)
  - Header length: `u32` (currently `104`)
  - Model id length: `u32`
  - Reserved: `u32`
  - Graph offset: `u64`
  - Graph length: `u64`
  - Data offset: `u64`
  - Data length: `u64`
  - Id map offset: `u64`
  - Id map length: `u64`
  - SHA-256 checksum: 32 bytes
- Payload blocks
  - Model id (UTF-8 bytes)
  - HNSW graph dump bytes
  - HNSW data dump bytes
  - Id map JSON bytes

The checksum is computed over the model id, graph, data, and id map bytes.
Model ids are limited to 16 KiB to avoid excessive allocations when loading
containers.

## Migration behavior

- On load, the system prefers the container file.
- If only legacy files exist, it loads them and rewrites the container next to
  the database, updating `ann_index_meta`.
- Legacy files are not deleted automatically.

## Cleanup

If disk space is a concern, remove the legacy `ann/` directory after verifying
the container file loads correctly. There is no automated cleanup step yet.
