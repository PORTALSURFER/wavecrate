## Downloads

- Windows binaries are published on GitHub Releases (Windows only for now).
- Publishing a release triggers a workflow that regenerates `CHANGELOG.md` via `git-cliff` and opens a PR (since `main` is protected).

## Build from source

- Requires Rust (stable toolchain) and `cargo`.
- From the project root: `cargo run --release`.
- Or build once and run the binary: `cargo build --release` then `target/release/sempal`.
- Playback uses your default audio output device.
- GUI backend selection (migration rollout):
  - Default is `native_vello` (radiant runtime path) to exercise the new backend.
  - `--gui-backend legacy_egui` runs the legacy compatibility UI path.
  - `--gui-backend native_vello` forces the native radiant path explicitly.
  - `SEMPAL_GUI_BACKEND` can also be set to `legacy_egui` or `native_vello`.
  - Native shell text rendering can use `SEMPAL_NATIVE_FONT_PATH=/path/to/font.ttf` if automatic system font discovery fails.
- Windows (ASIO): If you want to build with ASIO support (or your build fails looking for the ASIO SDK), download the Steinberg ASIO SDK and set `CPAL_ASIO_DIR` to the SDK path (e.g. a folder named `ASIOSDK`) before running `cargo build`/`cargo run`.

## ML model setup (PANNs)

- The app uses a PANNs model (burnpack) and requires the ONNX model to build the burnpack.
- Download + export the model once (Windows PowerShell):
  - `.\scripts\setup_panns.ps1`
- Or with Python directly:
  - `python .\scripts\setup_panns.py`
- By default, this writes to `%APPDATA%\\.sempal\\models`:
  - `panns_cnn14_16k.onnx`
  - `panns_cnn14_16k.bpk`
- Override locations if needed:
  - `SEMPAL_PANNS_ONNX_PATH` for the ONNX path
  - `SEMPAL_MODELS_DIR` for the models directory
- When downloading the ONNX model, provide an allowlisted HTTPS URL and its SHA-256 hash:
  - `SEMPAL_PANNS_ONNX_URL` and `SEMPAL_PANNS_ONNX_SHA256`
  - Override allowed hosts with `SEMPAL_PANNS_ONNX_ALLOWED_HOSTS` (comma-separated)

## Code style and linting

- Install tooling once: `rustup component add rustfmt clippy`.
- Format locally: `cargo fmt --all`.
- Check formatting (same as CI): `cargo fmt --all -- --check`.
- Lint locally (same as CI): `cargo clippy --all-targets`.
- CI runs `rustfmt`, `clippy`, and `cargo test` on Ubuntu/Windows/macOS for every push to `main`/`next` and all pull requests targeting those branches.

## Configuration and data

- Each source folder gets a hidden `.sempal_samples.db` that tracks indexed `.wav` files and their tags.
- App files live in a single `.sempal` folder inside your OS config directory:
  - Linux: `$HOME/.config/.sempal/config.toml`
  - Windows: `%APPDATA%\\.sempal\\config.toml`
  - macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/.sempal/config.toml`

## SQLite extensions (optional)

- Sempal can load a SQLite extension for faster vector operations via `SEMPAL_SQLITE_EXT`.
- Loading is opt-in with `SEMPAL_SQLITE_EXT_ENABLE=1` and restricted to `<app_root>/sqlite_extensions`.
- Unsafe mode (`SEMPAL_SQLITE_EXT_UNSAFE=1`) bypasses the allowlist, but it is ignored unless the build enables the `sqlite-ext-unsafe` cargo feature.
- If you need unsafe mode, rebuild with `cargo build --release --features sqlite-ext-unsafe` and supply a fully trusted extension path.

## Logging

- Startup initializes console logging and a per-launch log file under the same `.sempal` folder:
  - Linux: `$HOME/.config/.sempal/logs`
  - Windows: `%APPDATA%\\.sempal\\logs`
  - macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/.sempal/logs`
- Log filenames include the launch timestamp, and the 10 most recent files are retained by pruning the oldest.
